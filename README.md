## Introduction
  Thank you so much for downloading Blueprint.
  If you get stuck anywhere, don't hesitate to join our Discord (linked above).

  Always keep in mind that this is a work-in-progress resource and everything is subject to change.
  Some things may not work, please report them to us on our Discord.

## Installation
  Before we begin installing Blueprint, make sure you both have an SFTP and SSH client installed and have access to the server you want to install Blueprint on.

  Start by connecting to your server via SFTP and navigate to "/var/www/pterodactyl". Drag and drop the Blueprint files over to this directory (and make sure to overwrite files if asked by your client of choice).

  Now open your SSH client and connect to your server. Navigate to "/var/www/pterodactyl" using "cd /var/www/pterodactyl" and run "bash blueprint.sh". After doing this step, head over to your Pterodactyl panel and do "CTRL + SHIFT + R" or "CTRL + F5" for Blueprint's css styles to apply.

  That was it, if you ran into a problem during installation, please let us know. We are constantly working on making Blueprint better, and we can't do it without your help.
