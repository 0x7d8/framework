### Installation
**What you need:**
* The latest release of Blueprint. [Download ➚](https://github.com/teamblueprint/main/releases/latest)
* `unzip` [Download ➚](https://pkgs.org/download/unzip)
* Linux and Pterodactyl knowledge.
* Fingers and a brain.

**Installation:**
1. Navigate to `/var/www/pterodactyl`. (your Pterodactyl installation should be installed there, else it might not be compatible with Blueprint)
```sh
cd /var/www/pterodactyl
```
2. Run the Blueprint installation script. This runs the commands required for Blueprint to function correctly.
```sh
chmod +x blueprint.sh
bash blueprint.sh
```
3. After waiting for the installation script to finish, open up your Pterodactyl admin panel and click on the puzzle icon in the top right of the website.
